## How to replicate

### Code environment
The recommended way to replicate the necessary Python environment is via [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once Anaconda is ready on your machine, you can perform the following steps:

1. Download this repository.
2. Enter the directory, i.e. `cd ssp25-feature-attributions`.
3. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

The last command creates the 'ssp25' conda environment. You need to use this virtual environment to run the code.

### Replicating experiments
1. Open the file named [paper.ipynb](./paper.ipynb).
2. Select the 'ssp25' conda environment as your kernel of choice.
3. Run the code cells from top to bottom.
